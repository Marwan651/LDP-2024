# Pop!-OS

## Distribution History

##### Release date:
- Pop!\_OS was made by System76, but before we dive into Pop!\_OS release date, let's talk about System76.

- System76 is an American computer manufacturer founded by **Carl Richell** and **Erik Fetzer** In 2003 to sell computers with ***Linux*** operating systems preinstalled.

- In 2005 all computers that shipped from System76 came out of the box with Ubuntu preinstalled, and this is **very important** information.

- But in 2017 System76 decided to make a **BIG** change in their computer lineup and the ___Linux___ community; they decided to make their distribution the best distribution ever "**at least in my opinion**", they called it Pop!\_OS, and beginning from that moment they shipped all there computers with it. 
##### Based on distribution:
- Now let's talk more in technical detail, do you remember when I told you that System76 shipped their computers from 2005 with Ubuntu, guess what is the base distribution of Pop!\_OS..... you are right, it's Ubuntu.
- So, the question is why System76 decided to make their distribution!!?
  after small research, it turns out that they want to make more simpler OS for both beginners and professionals but we will dive into this in the Intended Users section.
